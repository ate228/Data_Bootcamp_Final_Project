**Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project**

This project was completed by Amy Elgin in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Fall 2017. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own.

The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative
expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.

And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester
or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for
the project and course.

**Project Description**
The NCAA has created a set of eligibility rules to ensure that student-athletes perform both on the playing field and in the classroom. These eligibility rules require students to pass a minimum of 12 credits each semester. Furthermore, a student-athlete must maintain a GPA of above 2.0 at all times. Schools invest a significant amount of money into their student-athletes, but also get significant monetary returns from their athletics programs through ticket sales and donors. However, many of these students will not play professional sports and will rely on their education to secure a job in the future. As a result, it is important to balance and monitor both a student-athlete's academic and athletic performance. This project looks at the Academic Progress Rate for NCAA division 1 institutions, which is a factor of a student-athlete's GPA, eligibility, and graduation rate.
